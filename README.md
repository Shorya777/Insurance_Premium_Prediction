## Machine Learning Models for Predicting Insurance Premium Estimates

### Description
Hello everyone! This project utilizes Kaggle's Insurance Premium dataset to train a machine learning model. We employ advanced data analysis and feature extraction techniques. Additionally, we implement a **DVC pipeline** for caching stages and log the trained machine learning models and experiments using **MLflow**.

### Instructions for Running Project
- Fork this repository
- Open the project's root directory in your terminal and type the command
  
  ```
  pip install -e .
  ```
